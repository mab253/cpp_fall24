# ü§ñ on A.I. use

This is an evolving topic - as a coder myself, I have been experimenting with light generative AI use in my workflow, and I understand that it's possible that a big part of anyone's coding (or writing, working, etc.) life in the future might involve smart use of these tools. **However**, as you are students learning to code, I have concerns about what learning processes are "skipped over" in your brain when you leap to asking AI to help you solve the problem. I have had students in the past say that it feels like an addictive habit, something that might help them solve a last-minute lab problem late at night but over time can hinder you actually knowing how to code. Whenever you hit a roadblock in your thinking, the next step can't always be to look up an easy answer. We need to understand _how_ and _why_ our code works - and further, in order to use these tools well in the future, you need to be able to learn to prompt with the _right_ questions. We will talk a lot more about this during the semester. 

That said: I know these tools are out there and being used. I can only highly encourage you to use generative AI tools mostly as a tutor, asking general questions to deepen your understanding of the material rather than asking the bot to generate answers. **In this class, you will need to cite WHENEVER you use generative AI tools (chatGPT, etc.) to improve your code or come up with a solution.**

Example: 

```
/* -----
This code was written with the aid of ChatGPT;
when prompted 'how do I overload a constructor in my class?'
the generated text helped me write the following code:
accessed: Nov. 2023
 -------- */
```
*You do not need to follow this format exactly, but your comment should cite the same information (prompt, source, and date if possible)*

**üí•‚û°Ô∏è This commenting and citation of code is NOT OPTIONAL.** If you do not cite code where you have copied either the exact lines or the inspiring method of someone else, this could be considered plagiarism in the context of this class, on homework exercises, labs, assessments, or projects. **The consequences for failing to cite AI or other external sources in this class can include failing the assignment, or indeed failing the course.** 

**A note on code found online:**
Inside your functional code, if you have used code that comes from any other programmer or another project, you also need to cite this explicitly. You can write a comment directly above where this code starts, and cite the source by including the project name, the programmer's name (if known), and a link to where you found this code. Include the date that you found it, if possible.

For example: 

```
/***********
  This code was adapted from:
  David Bowie
  https://github.com/davidjonesbowie/the_exact_file_where_you_found_the_.code
  Accessed: Oct. 2022
*************/
```
*You do not need to follow this format exactly, but your comment should cite the same information (name, link/source, and date if possible)*

In written language for a paper, we also cite when it's not a direct quote, but it is an *idea* that we learned from a specific source. If you have parts of your code that fit this description, please comment and cite here as well. 

Example:

```
/* The following method is inspired by work done by Proton the Cat,
Jupyter notebook available @ https://github.com/proton-the-cat */
```
You do not need to cite the textbook (zyBooks) or class notes - I am assuming most of the methods that you are learning are coming from there!
